## AMD Relive Instant Replay recording the wrong monitor fix

This project was made for a problem that I feel like only me and 7 other people in the entire AMD community has.

It allows your monitors to turn themselves on and off again in an order for AMD Relive's Instant Replay to focus on the first one.

The batch file ```ForceRefresh.bat``` runs the script for this action and ```Fix_AMD_ReLive_Monitor.vbs``` is simply to run the batch file silently.

You can enable/disable this program to run on startup

## Installing

Download ```startup_manager.exe``` and run the executable

### Requirements

- [Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/) installed
- AMD Radeon (obviously)
